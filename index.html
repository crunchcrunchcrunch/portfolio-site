                  <p class="para">Hi I’m Darya! I’m a graphic designer who’s constantly setting the bar higher for myself with every project. I draw inspiration from everyday life, especially from simple, often overlooked moments to create visuals with engaging storytelling. My work has seen a variety of fields, ranging from healthcare to local music scenes. No matter what or who I’m designing for, I make sure that with every design I’m finding new ways to connect with my audience and using it as an opportunity to grow. </p>
